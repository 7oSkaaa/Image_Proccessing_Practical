            "description": "The median filter is a non-linear digital filtering technique, often used to remove noise from an image or signal. Such noise reduction is a typical pre-processing step to improve the results of later processing (for example, edge detection on an image). Median filtering is very widely used in digital image processing because, under certain conditions, it preserves edges while removing noise (but see the discussion below), also having applications in signal processing."

            "description": "Average (or mean) filtering is a method of 'smoothing' images by reducing the amount of intensity variation between neighbouring pixels. The average filter works by moving through the image pixel by pixel, replacing each value with the average value of neighbouring pixels, including itself"

            "description": "Contrast stretching (often called normalization) is a simple image enhancement technique that attempts to improve the contrast in an image by 'stretching' the range of intensity values it contains to span a desired range of values, the full range of pixel values that the image type concerned allows."

            "title": "Histogram equalization",
            "description": "This method usually increases the global contrast of many images, especially when the usable data of the image is represented by close contrast values. Through this adjustment, the intensities can be better distributed on the histogram. This allows for areas of lower local contrast to gain a higher contrast. Histogram equalization accomplishes this by effectively spreading out the most frequent intensity values.\nThe method is useful in images with backgrounds and foregrounds that are both bright or both dark. In particular, the method can lead to better views of bone structure in x-ray images, and to better detail in photographs that are over or under-exposed. A key advantage of the method is that it is a fairly straightforward technique and an invertible operator. So in theory, if the histogram equalization function is known, then the original histogram can be recovered. The calculation is not computationally intensive. A disadvantage of the method is that it is indiscriminate. It may increase the contrast of background noise, while decreasing the usable signal."
