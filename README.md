## Roberts cross operator

The Roberts cross operator is used in image processing and computer vision for edge detection. It was one of the first edge detectors and was initially proposed by Lawrence Roberts in 1963.[1] As a differential operator, the idea behind the Roberts cross operator is to approximate the gradient of
an image through discrete differentiation which is achieved by computing the sum of the squares of the differences between diagonally adjacent pixels.

According to Roberts, an edge detector should have the following properties: the produced edges should be well-defined, the background should contribute as little noise as possible, and the intensity of edges should correspond as close as possible to what a human would perceive.
With these criteria in mind and based on then prevailing psychophysical theory Roberts proposed the following equations:
